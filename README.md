# PRIMUS
**Primus** is a project focused on exploring swarm robotics by creating a modular and easily replicable robot platform. Utilizing a 3-wheel omni-drive configuration with omni-wheels, the robot achieves multidirectional movement without changing orientation. Designed with Autodesk Fusion 360, the hexagonal acrylic body houses the essential electronics, including an ESP32 microcontroller, 12V motors, an L298 motor driver, and a Neopixel RGB LED strip for visual flair. Powered by an 11.1V Li-Ion battery, Primus showcases a combination of mechanical design, electronics, and web server-based remote control. Future iterations will explore more advanced swarm behaviors.
